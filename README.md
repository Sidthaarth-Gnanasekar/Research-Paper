The repository have been created only to showcase the research papers completed in the field machine learning and deep learning.

* ## Algorithmic Trading Bot:
    * This research paper mainly discusses about the time series forecasting prediction by most effective machine learning and deep learning algorithms. These models are trained to predict the bitcoin closing price on the lower timeframe (For Ex: In this paper, the models has been trained with the one minute data). After training and testing the different models, the best model is fed to our trading bot and that takes the trades based on our model prediction.
